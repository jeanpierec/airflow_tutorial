# My First Apache Airflow Project

This repository contains code for my first Apache Airflow project. The project uses Airflow to create, schedule, and monitor data pipelines.

## What is Apache Airflow?

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows users to create directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks, which can then be scheduled to run on a defined interval or triggered by external events.

Airflow provides a user-friendly web interface for users to manage workflows, track task progress, and troubleshoot issues. It also supports integration with external systems and technologies, making it a versatile tool for data pipeline management.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Docker
- Git

## Installation

To install and set up Apache Airflow and Docker for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone <repository URL>`.
2. Create a new Python environment for this project using the command `python -m venv <name of environment>`. Replace `<name of environment>` with the name you want to give your environment.
3. Activate the virtual environment by running the command `<name of environment>\\\\Scripts\\\\activate.bat` on Windows or `<name of environment>/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux.
4. Install the required Python packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Start the Docker daemon using the command `docker run -d -p 2375:2375 docker:stable-dind`.
6. Set the Docker host environment variable using the command `set DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375`.
7. Initialize the Airflow database using the command `airflow initdb`.
8. Start the Airflow web server using the command `airflow webserver -p 8080`.
9. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to access the Airflow web interface.

That's it! You have successfully set up Apache Airflow and Docker for this project. From here, you can create DAGs and tasks, schedule workflows, and monitor progress using the Airflow web interface.

## Conclusion

Apache Airflow is a powerful and flexible platform for workflow automation and management, widely used in data engineering, machine learning, and data science applications. By following the steps in this README file, you can quickly set up Airflow and Docker for your project and start creating and managing workflows.
